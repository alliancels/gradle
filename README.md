This fork adds support for :
 - The IAR ARM toolchain.  A working example can be found [here](https://github.com/alliancels/gradle/tree/platform-native-iar/subprojects/docs/src/samples/native-binaries/iar-arm).
 - The Unity testing framework. A working example can be found [here](https://github.com/alliancels/gradle/tree/platform-native-iar/subprojects/docs/src/samples/native-binaries/unity).

The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/alliancels/gradle/releases), and can be differentiated from the official Gradle releases by the '-iar-arm' suffix.
